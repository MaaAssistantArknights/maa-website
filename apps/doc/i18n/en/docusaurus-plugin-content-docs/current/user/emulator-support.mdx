# Emulator Supports

## ‚úÖ Bluestacks

Fully compatible. Need to turn on `Settings` - `Engine Settings` - `Allow ADB connection`.

## ‚úÖ Bluestacks Global Version (Recommended üëç )

Fully compatible. Need to turn on `Settings` - `Advanced` - `Android Debug Bridge`.

## ‚úÖ Bluestacks Hyper-V Version

Compatible.

- Turn on `Settings` - `Advanced` - `Android Debug Bridge`.
- Bluestack Hyper-V port changes frequently. Here is a simple hack:

  1. Find `bluestacks.conf` in the data location of the emulator. (Default is `C:\ProgramData\BlueStacks_nxt\bluestacks.conf`)
  2. If you are using MAA for the first time, Launch it, which generates `gui.json`.
  3. Exit MAA then open the `gui.json`, add a new field `Bluestacks.Config.Path`, with the value of the full path of `bluestacks.conf` (backslash should be escaped like `\\`). like:

  ```json
  "Bluestacks.Config.Path":"C:\\ProgramData\\BlueStacks_nxt\\bluestacks.conf",
  ```

  4. LinkStart!

## ‚úÖ Nox

Fully compatible.

## ‚úÖ Nox Android 9

Fully compatible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MuMu

Compatible but:

- Requires MAA to "Run as Administrator" to get ADB path and address (since MuMu runs as admin).
- You can also fill in the ADB path and address if you do not wish to run as admin.
- It has a chance that MAA may stuck at the main screen and prompt mission failed, which is probably related to the rendering method of MuMu. Recommend to change other emulator.

## üö´ MuMu Mobile Game Assistant

Incompatible. ADB port is not open.

## üö´ MuMu Android 9

Incompatible. ADB screenshot is black.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Leidian

Compatible.

But the connection address will change between `127.0.0.1:5555` and `emulator-5554`, varies from device to device, or may change after restarting. Try another when one address is not available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEmu

Compatible, but some recognition error may occur.

## üö´ Tencent Mobile Game Assistant

Incompatible. ADB port is not open.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Win11 WSA

Partially compatible.

- Need to connect with [Custom Connection](#custom-connection). Try `Legacy WSA` or `General Configuration` to connect.
- Since WSA does not support changing resolution, please resize the window manually because this program supports 720p or higher `16:9` resolution better. (Or you can simply maximize the window with `F11` if your monitor is 16:9.)
- Sometimes the screenshot of WSA may be blank, causing recognition failure. So it is not recommended to use WSA.

## ‚úÖ AVD

Compatible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Connection

1. Download [adb](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) and unzip.
2. Go to `Settings` - `Connection Settings`, and fill in ADB path and address (IP+port is required, e.g. `127.0.0.1:5555`)

**Note:** Some features on mobile phone with non-`16:9` resolution is not stable, especially the Infrastructure. We are working in progress to make it compatible. `16:9` is the most recommended resolution since it is tested stable in most of the time.
You can set resolution with `adb shell wm size` on your phone and change it back later.
