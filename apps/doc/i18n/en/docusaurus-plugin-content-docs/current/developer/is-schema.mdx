# Integrated Strategy (I.S.) Schema

Usage of `resource/roguelike/*.json` and description of each field

## Overview

```json
{
  "stage_name": "驯兽小屋", // Stage name, required
  "actions": [
    // Actions in order, required. Will be executed sequentially
    {
      "type": "部署", // Action type, optional, "Deploy" by default
      // "Deploy" | "Skill" | "Retreat" | "AllSkill"
      // "部署"   |  "技能"  |  "撤退"   | "全部技能"
      // Both English and Chinese are supported
      // "Deploy" will wait until the cost is enough (unless timeout)
      // "Skill" will wait until the skill is ready (unless timeout)
      // Use it based on skill effects and CDs of operators (e.g. Mountain: Sweeping Stance, switchable skill)
      // "AllSkill" will use all skills of operators with `skill_usage == 3`

      "kills": 0, // Waiting until the number of kills required is reached, optional, 0 by default
      // TODO: Other conditions
      // TODO: "condition_type": 0,    // Condition aggregation type, optional, 0 by default
      //                        // 0 - AND； 1 - OR

      "roles": [
        // Classes of the operators, optional, empty by default, meaning all classes are acceptable
        // The list is ordered, with the first item having the highest priority
        // Meele/ranged operators are chosen automatically. Non-deployable operators will be ignored.
        // The list will be skipped if none of the classes are available.
        "近卫", // Guard
        "先锋", // Vanguard
        "重装", // Defender
        "召唤物" // Summon
      ],

      "waiting_cost": false, // Whether to wait for the cost to be enough for class with higher priority in `roles` list, optional, `false` by default
      // `true` means to use existing class in the `roles` list that has the highest priority, waiting for the cost to be enough.
      // `false` means to use existing class in the `roles` list that has the highest priority and enough cost.

      "location": [5, 5], // Location of the operator, required

      "direction": "左", // Direction for deployment, required when `type` is "Deploy"
      // "Left" | "Right" | "Up" | "Down" | "None"
      // "左"   |  "右"   | "上"  | "下"   |  "无"
      // Both English and Chinese are supported

      "pre_delay": 0, // Pre-delay in ms, optional, 0 by default
      "rear_delay": 0, // Post-delay in ms, optional, 0 by default

      "timeout": 999999999 // Timeout time in ms, optional when `type` is "Deploy", INT_MAX by default
      // Will proceed with the next action when timeout
    },
    {
      // Example
      "location": [6, 6],
      "roles": [
        "近卫", // Guard
        "先锋", // Vanguard
        "重装", // Defender
        "召唤物" // Summon
      ],
      "direction": "左"
    }
  ]
